Exam exercise for the Interface Development course.

This simple program consists of the user having to guess a random number that is generated each time the program is run.

If a non-numeric value is entered, an error message will be displayed on the screen:

Each time a wrong number is entered, one attempt will be subtracted (from the 5 available) and a message will be displayed on the screen saying if the number to guess is greater or less than the one entered:

When the attempts are exhausted, the game will be over and the text box and button will be disabled, so that the user cannot continue playing:

If the user guesses the number, a message will be displayed informing that he has won and the elements will be disabled as well:

Finally, it must also be said that there is a menu bar, which allows the user to start a new game or close the program:
